# Customer Churn Analysis

## Objective
This analysis aims to explore customer churn patterns and identify key factors associated with higher churn rates. By understanding these factors, we can guide customer retention strategies and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Key Insights

1. **Contract Type and Churn**
   - Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit the highest churn rate (42%).
   - In contrast, customers on one-year and two-year contracts have significantly lower churn rates (11% and 3%, respectively).
   - **Implication:** Encouraging long-term contracts could reduce churn, as customers with extended commitments tend to stay longer.

2. **Payment Methods and Churn**
   - Customers using electronic checks have a churn rate of 45%, whereas those using credit cards, bank transfers, or mailed checks experience lower churn rates (15-18%).
   - **Implication:** Switching customers to stable payment methods may reduce churn, possibly due to enhanced convenience and security.

3. **Churn Rate by Tenure**
   - Churn is highest among customers with less than one year of tenure (50%) and decreases significantly with longer tenure (35% for 1-3 years, and 15% for over 3 years).
   - **Implication:** Engaging customers early is critical to retention, especially within the first year.

4. **Churn by Internet Service Type**
   - Customers using Fiber Optic services show a higher churn rate (30%) compared to DSL users (20%).
   - **Implication:** Reviewing and addressing service quality concerns could help retain fiber optic customers.

5. **Senior Citizens and Churn**
   
   - Senior citizens (aged 65+) have a churn rate of 41%, compared to a 26% rate among non-senior citizens.
   - **Implication:** Specialized retention programs may help retain senior customers more effectively.

## Visualizations & Data Insights

- **Bar Charts and Line Graphs** illustrate disparities in churn rates across contract types, payment methods, and tenure, highlighting the importance of personalized retention strategies.
